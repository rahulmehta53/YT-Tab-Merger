# YT-Tab-Merger
A Chrome extension that prevents duplicate YouTube watch tabs. If a video is already open, and you open youtube link of the same video from external app pdf, obsidian then it updates the timestamp in the existing tab instead of opening a new one, ensuring seamless playback continuation.
